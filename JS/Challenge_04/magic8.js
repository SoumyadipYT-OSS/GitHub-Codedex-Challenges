/*
The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940's for fortune-telling and advice seeking. 🎱

It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

Yes - definitely.
It is decidedly so.
Without a doubt.
Reply hazy, try again.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.
Create a magic8.js program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

The output should have the following format:

Question:       [Question]
Magic 8 Ball:   [Answer]

For example:

Question:       Is Codédex better than Udemy yet?
Magic 8 Ball:   Better not tell you now.
