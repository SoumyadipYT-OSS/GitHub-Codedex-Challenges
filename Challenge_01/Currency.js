    We just got back from a trip to Asia, specifically China, Japan, and South Korea. When we got back we have some leftover cash:

        ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ Chinese yuan
        ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japanese yen
        ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· South Korean won
        Create a currency.js program that starts with the amount you have in yuan, yen, and won and calculates the total in USD.

        Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!

        The output of the program should look like this:

        What do you have left in yuan? 560
        What do you have left in yen? 2455
        What do you have left in won? 3280

        105.5275
        Cha-ching! Now you have the total in USD. ğŸ’°
